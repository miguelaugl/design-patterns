## What is a design pattern?

In [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/), we can find this definition: *Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.*

## Classification

The patterns can be categorized by their intent or purpose:

* **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

* **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

* **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
